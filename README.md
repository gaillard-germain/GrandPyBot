# GrandPy'bot
GrandPy'bot is the result of my project 7 as part of my Open Classrooms training as a Python developer.
It's a web application that allows a user to enter a question regarding the location of a place, it will return an address, a map, and some additional information relating to his request. (at this time, only the French language is available.)
## Programming Languages
- python
- HTML5 CSS3
- JavaScript Jquery
## Modules
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
## Tests
Using Pytest
there are 2 tests functions:
- test_answer: will test the dict send to Ajax (mocking responses from APIs).
- test_parser: will test the parsing of the user's entry.
## Heroku
You can try GrandPy'bot at this address: https://sp-grandpybot.herokuapp.com/
## Sources
This app uses APIs from Google and Wiki Media.
And it was developed with Flask framework.
