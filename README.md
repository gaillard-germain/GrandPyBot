# GrandPy'bot
GrandPy'bot is the result of my project 7 as part of my Open Classrooms training as a Python developer.
It's a web application that allows a user to enter a question regarding the location of a place, it will return an address, a map, and some additional information relating to his request. (at this time, only the French language is available.)
